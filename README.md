#  Multiplication Table Generator (Revision Project)

This is a basic Python project created as part of my revision. It generates multiplication tables from 1 to 10 using both `for` loops.

# What I Practiced:
- `for` loop syntax
- Loop conditions and updates
- Nested loops for table structure
- Clean console output formatting
